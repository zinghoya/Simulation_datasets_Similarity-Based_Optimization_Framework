Building_Demand.csv


We used weather, PV output, demand, and electricity price data for our simulations.
For weather data, we obtained permission from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) for online use.
In addition, we uploaded the price data of day-ahead, real-time, and ancillary services electricity market from the Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland (PJM).
However, due to privacy issues, we can only provide virtual PV output data and numerical demand data without details of their exact locations and internal elements.
